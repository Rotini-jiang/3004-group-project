Finally the last week of doing the project, I was trying to implement the very last function of
our project, which is the notification, I have tried many ways to realize this, but I found most of
the tutorials online are out of time, the methods they use are no longer supported in the newest
version of android studio. the app will keep stopping when there is a notification pushing to the user.
I tried several days to figure out the bugs, but I have no idea why this happens, and my team members
cannot help me on this feature, so we decide to delete this feature or redo it in other ways, but it is not
finally decided when I write this log.
